        <h1>GETTING USED TO MONEY</h1>
        <P>Hae.I've been living in an empty place.Okay,the word empty is a bit exagerated but here is the point,<br>I have just about 10%of what I actually need.I'm long overdue for a nice shopping to fill out the blanks in my room.</P>
        <p>Nothing makes me happier than a restocked place.<br>When I can have whatever I want without having to go out of way or an extra great walk to search for one tiny requirement. </p>
        <p>First things first.Though not all restocking makes me happy,<strong>food</strong> in particular does excite me.So food first to get the experience a bit motivating.</p>
